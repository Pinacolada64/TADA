Hello:
I want to add a feature to a program, when, and if there is ever a
SYNTAX ERROR, UNDEFINED STATEMENT ERROR, or any of the other BASIC
errors message, An ML routine will record the error into a string, and
JMP to a predefined Line Number in the program. Image BBS has this
function, but im not too sure on how to write it. $0039 is CURLIN,
where is the buffer for the Error messages? How to i write an ML
routine that GOTO's a certain line # in the BASIC program? Any
assistance will be greatly appreciated.

Hi Steve,

sorry if I produce another misunderstanding (I have not read the
BBS-threads that maybe are related to this topic...) You want to stop
a running BASIC program on a C64 if an error occurs and to proceed
with your own error handlung in ML? This can be done by changing the
pointers for the BASIC error message routine $300,301 and/or the BASIC
Main Loop $302,301. I have done this for a ML-controlled BASIC-run in
a spreadsheet. I directed the BASIC error message to a working area,
catched BASIC in the main loop before returning to direct-mode and
read the error message from the working area - if I remeber correctly.

Can this be helpful for you? If yes, I will dig out the docs. If not -
no problem ;-)

Franz

Franz:
What you described is what i want to write. I want to write an ML
routine that whenever there is any kind of BASIC error, it prints the
BASIC error message to the screen, and then goes to a certain line
number in the BASIC program. So the program will never "crash" due to
a Syntax, Undefined Statement, Illegal quantity, or any other kind of
BASIC error. instead of the program stopping, it will goto, lets say,
Line Number 1500.

Hi Steve,
you have to change the vector of the BASIC Main loop in 770/771
$302/303, so that it points to this ML routine:

new basic main loop:
  lda #$00
  jsr $FF90 ;set control flag for running BASIC program again
  lda l-byte line number
  ldy h-byte line number
  sta $14 ; set new line number
  sty $15
  jsr $A8A3 ; perform GOTO
  jmp $A7AE ; execute next BASIC statement

"line number" ist the number of the BASIC-Line where you want the
program to continue.

Franz

Franz:
Thanks for posting actual code. If im following you right, why wont
this work. It goes to the specified line number, but something isnt
right. Am i going to have to add your routine as an interrupt? Here is
what i threw together, and it isnt working. It sounded easy, and
looked easy, but it took me months to figure out the vector thing.

        *=$c000

start   lda     #<test
        sta     $0302
        lda     #>test
        sta     $0303
        rts

test    lda     #$00
        jsr     $FF90	;set control flag for running BASIC program again

        lda     #$dc	;l-byte line number "00"
        ldy     #$05	;h-byte line number "15"

        sta     $14		; set new line number
        sty     $15

        jsr     $A8A3	; perform GOTO
        jmp     $A7AE	; execute next BASIC statement

when i do the sys49152, it just prints undefined statement error, over
and over, and if i load in the routine, then in basic type 1500 end,
and do the sys49152 it will print ready. over and over. Please tell me
what im doing wrong. Looks easy, and it looks as if it should run
right.

Sorry to post twice. Where do you guys find these memory address?
Ex.$a8a3,$a7ae? Are they in Mapping The 64? I have a 64 programmers

Mapping the 64 does have many of these routines documented and listed.

Franz' routine is actually working correctly. What it is intended to do
is hook the BASIC warm start routine to prevent the program from exiting.
It will run line 1500 instead of going back to BASIC direct mode.

When you typed sys49152 from the command line, you were setting this up
to run in direct mode. With no line 1500, as soon as direct mode started,
it failed with a undefined statement error, and then had to run line 1500
again, and ...

In your second attempt, you put an END in, which caused direct mode to
start, which caused it to run line 1500 with an END, which caused
direct mode to start, ...

A better test case would be this.

10 e=peek(770):f=peek(771):sys49152
20 print"make me fail with a zero here"
22 print"or -1 to return to basic"
30 input w
32 if w=-1thenpoke770,e:poke771,f:print"wimp":end
40 print "4/w =";4/w
50 goto 30
1500 print "can't make me crash."
1510 print "back to the loop, dude!"
1520 goto 20

Hi Steve,
the code I posted is very primitive, it needs a few refinements. If
the line number 1500 does not exist, it will produce and endless loop.
You could set up a counter of errors or any other control mechanism in
order to stop this. And if you want to end the BASIC program, you must
restore the vector 770/771 to the original value (131/164) before the
END.

A better methode would be to change the BASIC error vector $300/301 in
addition, and to redirect it to a very short ML code. When the BASIC
interpreter jumps to this vector, the X-register holds the error
number. Store this error number somewhere, and also store the current
value of the control flag $9D. Afterwards JMP to the original address
$E38B (the X-register must be unchanged). Thats all concerning the
error message vector. Now, concerning the code for the new BASIC main
loop, you first can test if there was a program running or if there
was direct mode. In direct mode the stored control flag was $80, and
you better jump to the original address of the BASIC main loop $A483.
Next you can check if there was an error. If the stored error number
is $80, there was no error but the program ended. You can jump to the
original address in this case as well. If the error number was
positive, there was an error, and now you run the code for starting
the BASIC program at line number 1500.

This will prevent the undesirable effects you described :-)

Franz:
Ok, i think i have it figured out now. I was hoping once line 1500 was
executed, Ex. 1500 end , the program would just end, but, if i
returned the original values of IMAIN at line 1500 the program would
stop. I appreciate you posting actual code here, and have learned
alot! If i may, i have another question. In the vector IERROR, the
actual error message # is stored in the x register. Do you know how i
could find a list of the error messages?

ldx#$00
jsr $a3ed ;loop
inx
cpx   ;how many error message are there?
jmp loop
rts

Hi Steve,
there is a list sorted by error number in "Mapping the Commodore 64".
(Memory location 41374.) An e-version can be downloaded at Project 64

> ldx#$00
> jsr $a3ed ;loop

I have not tested the real effect, but $a3ed does not seem to be a
valid adress (something in the middle of the routine for moving memory
contents). Did you want to print the error messages by number? The
error routine can´t be called as a subroutine. You only can jmp $e38b,
and after printing the error message and restoring some parameters
(including stack) the routine ends in the BASIC main loop.

You can get a list of BASIC errors in BASIC direct mode, without
changing any vectors:

poke 781,x : rem set x-register
sys 58251 : rem call error message routine $e38b

x is the number of the error message, ranging from 1 to 30.

thanks for all the help!! i got the routine(s) to work today, took me
awhile, but got them working. You seem to understand Machine Language
pretty good, and i have 1 last question, sort of ML related. IM using
TurboASSembler (TASS) to compile my source written in Notepad. Ive
added these labels for data..

err1     .text     "too many files open error"
err2     .text     "file open error"
err3     .text     "file not open error"
err4     .text     "file not found error"

etc, untill i have all 30 of them added/labled.

I want to write 1 routine, that uses the X register to read from each
label, instead of writing (30) routines to print each labled error
messages. Or am i going to have to use 30 different routine to print
each error message? Could i store all of them in 1 big ".text" and use
a pointer to find each one? Or is there a way to assign the value of
each label to an address, and then write 1 routine that print from
that address,y ?

A slow but easy methode would be to seperate the messages with a Zero
and to count them. I don´t know TASS, but maybe it looks like that:

err   .byte 0
      .text "message 1"
      .byte 0
      .text "message 2"
      .byte 0
      (...)
      .text "message 30"
      .byte 0

You set a pointer in zeropage to the address of "err" and start
reading. The error number has to be in register x.

  ldy #$00

loop 1             ;count zeros in datablock
  lda (pointer),y
  inc <pointer     ;increment pointer
  bne check
  inc >ponter

check
  cmp #$00         ;zero?
  bne loop 1       ;no
  dex              ;yes, count down message number
  bne loop 1       ;not the requested number, continue

loop 2             ;read found message
  lda (pointer),y
  beq finished     ;end of message, quit loop
  sta somewhere,y  ;y is zero at start of the message
  iny
  jmp loop 2

Another methode would be to to store the address of each message in a
table and to read the table with the error number as index, in order
to get the address of each message. This is how the BASIC interpreter
does it. Btw., why do you want to write your own routine for error
messages, while the built-in Software already does this job?

> A slow but easy methode would be to seperate the messages with a Zero

The system uses probably a similar concept but
without the need to store a zero for each message.

29 of the BASIC language diagnostics are stored in memory beginning at
location $a19e and ending at memory location $a327.  The only missing
diagnostic is 'break'.  The letters of a diagnostic are lower case
except that the last character which is capitolized.  Upper case
letters will cause the negative flag in the status register to be set
when loaded.  Loading lower case letters will clear the negative flag.
Starting at the beginning of diagnostics at $a19e, you need to count
the times you set the negative flag while the counter is less than the
error number.  When the counter is equal to the error number, you have
encountered the first letter of the diagnostic for the current error.
You print the diagnostic until you set the negative flag again.
