# TADA Mechanics Roadmap

Tracks game mechanics from the SPUR source that are either implemented, partially
implemented, or not yet started. Source references are to files under `SPUR-code/`.

---

## Combat

### Implemented
- **Player attack roll** — to-hit vs. monster dexterity; ease-of-use check (`resolution.py`)
- **Player damage** — base damage (stability) + class/race bonus + XP scaling (`resolution.py`)
- **Monster attack** — hit/miss vs. player stats; light/heavy armor reduction (`resolution.py`)
- **Special weapons** — `check_special_weapon()` enforces per-monster required weapon; EXCALIBUR ×2 vs evil/÷2 vs good; WRAITH DAGGER +40 vs wraith #70 (`resolution.py`)
- **STORM — asserts its will** — 30% auto-attack when monster has attacked fewer than 6 times (`engine.py`, `SPUR.COMBAT.S:59`)
- **STORM — armor penetration** — +XP after armor reduction for STORM/CANNON/hack-slash (`resolution.py`, `SPUR.COMBAT.S:158`)
- **STORM — screams in glee** — message on monster kill if STORM weapon readied (`engine.py`, `SPUR.COMBAT.S:197`)
- **STORM — scare** — 10% chance loud weapon scares unarmored monster in first 2 exchanges (`resolution.py`, `SPUR.COMBAT.S:423–430`)
- **Surprise attack** — when monster has not yet spotted player, +2 to-hit + damage for player (`resolution.py`)
- **Double attack** — 40% chance of a second monster attack in rooms marked `]` (`engine.py`)
- **Allies** — up to 3 allies attack each round; morale failure / sacrifice on near-death (`engine.py`)
- ✅ **Ally death-save** — before a blow that would kill the player lands, an owned ally gets a chance to intervene: GOD/GODDESS allies always teleport the player to safety and depart for good; others roll courage (vs. player honor, elites get a bonus) and either flee (freed) or "leap in front" as flavor — only a GOD/GODDESS save actually cancels the damage, matching SPUR.MISC9.S exactly (`SPUR.COMBAT.S` `dragon`/`sac.ally`, `ally_events.py` `try_ally_death_save()`, `engine.py` `_resolve_monster_hit()`)
- ✅ **LASSO — capture a mount** — during combat against a horse-named monster, `lasso` captures it as a new MOUNT-flagged ally (name prompt with SPUR's length/character validation); blocked by a full party or an existing mount (`SPUR.USE.S` `lasso`, `commands/lasso.py`, `engine.py` `CombatSession.lasso()`)
- **XP gain per swing** (`engine.py`)
- **Monster kill rewards** — gold and XP awarded on kill (`engine.py`, `combat/rewards.py`)

### Not Implemented

#### Weapon / attack mechanics
- ✅ **Ammo system (core)** — "NO AMMO READY" blocks attack for projectile/energy weapons; ammo consumed per shot; `ammo_damage` added to hit; STORM bypasses ammo (`SPUR.COMBAT.S:44,84,144`, `resolution.py`, `engine.py`)
- **Ammo — burst/auto-fire modes** — S/B/A fire-mode prompt; burst and auto consume multiple rounds per swing (`SPUR.COMBAT.S:98–101`)
- ✅ **Stray round / friendly fire** — missed ammo shot may hit ally or bystander; chance scales by weapon XP: GREEN 1-in-3, VETERAN 1-in-6, ELITE 1-in-10; 1–4 HP damage; ally killed if HP reaches 0 (`engine.py` `_stray_round()`)
- ✅ **Ammo recovery** — after killing a monster, bow/sling/blowgun weapons recover 1–max random rounds; message uses weapon-specific term (arrows/stones/darts) (`SPUR.MISC.S:427`, `engine.py` `_recover_ammo()`)
- ✅ **USE ammo command** — loads ammo into a readied ranged weapon; checks `used_with`; STORM refuses physical ammo (`SPUR.USE.S:147–162`, `commands/use.py`)
- ✅ **Missile: first strike** — when ammo is loaded and monster hasn't attacked yet, monster skips its first swing; "MISSILE: FIRST STRIKE!" message (`SPUR.COMBAT.S:219`, `engine.py`)
- ✅ **Pole weapon: first strike** — roll + (monster agility × 3) + 2 < player DEX → first strike; otherwise monster swings normally (`SPUR.COMBAT.S:221`, `engine.py`)
- **Fireball/energy weapon secondary damage** — 10% chance of secondary heat damage (`SPUR.COMBAT.S:143`)
- **LURK mode** — player fires over allies' shoulders; to-hit penalty; requires at least one living ally (`SPUR.COMBAT.S:87–96`)
- ✅ **Assassin critical hit** — class 8 (Assassin), 10% chance to double damage (`SPUR.COMBAT.S:135`, `resolution.py:435`)
- ✅ **Ease-of-use help message** — "(Ease of use helps!)" when roll barely misses and ease-of-use score would have made the difference (`SPUR.COMBAT.S:139`, `resolution.py:416`, `engine.py:541`)
- ✅ **Bad weapon choice warning** — "(bad weapon choice)" when `p2 < 3` (`SPUR.COMBAT.S:119`)

#### Defence
- **Shield** — blocks some incoming damage; degrades; can be destroyed; max rating varies by class/race; shield items usable via USE command (`SPUR.COMBAT.S`, `SPUR.USE.S:34–43`)
- **Armor** — degrades each hit; "ARMOR GONE" when reaches 0; heavy armor blocks more but is not penetrated by STORM/CANNON (`SPUR.COMBAT.S:289–302`)
- **Gauntlets** — absorb one hit (10% chance destroyed) when player takes a hit (`SPUR.COMBAT.S:210–217`, `SPUR.WEAPON.S:spec4`)
- **Wizard's glow** — item `zu$[7]` values 2/3 reduce incoming damage by 2 (`SPUR.COMBAT.S:266`)
- **Lazer shield** — energized shield variant; blocks laser fire at half damage (`SPUR.USE.S:86`)
- **Power armor** — specific item; halves blast damage (`SPUR.USE.S:124`)

#### Monster abilities
- **Monster spellcasting** — monsters with `+` flag in `wy$` can cast spells when low HP (`SPUR.COMBAT.S` `lnk.msc4`)
- **Turn to stone** — monsters with `#` flag; 10% chance per attack; player dies if fails second roll (`SPUR.COMBAT.S:229–235`)
- **Monster fire/laser** — monsters with `-` flag shoot fire; laser-equipped rooms use laser fire (`SPUR.COMBAT.S:240–248`)
- ✅ **Poison on hit** — monsters with `poisonous_attack` flag; 30% chance per hit (`SPUR.COMBAT.S:312–313`, `resolution.py:639`, `engine.py:603`)
- ✅ **Disease on hit** — monsters with `diseased_attack` flag; 30% chance per hit (`SPUR.COMBAT.S:315–316`, `resolution.py:641`, `engine.py:605`)
- ✅ **Experience drain on hit** — monsters with `experience_drain` flag; drains XP on hit (`SPUR.COMBAT.S:317`, `resolution.py:655`, `engine.py:611`)
- **Multiple guards** — if player is treacherous in a guard room, whistles summon more guards and monster HP multiplies (`SPUR.COMBAT.S mad.gd`)
- ✅ **Dexterity loss on heavy hit** — taking >4 damage reduces player DEX by 1 (`SPUR.COMBAT.S:318`, `engine.py:583`)
- ✅ **Dexterity gain** — dealing >4 damage has small chance to increase player DEX (`SPUR.COMBAT.S:143`, `engine.py:335`)
- ✅ **Wisdom gain on kill** — player `pw` increases by 1 on every non-ally kill (`SPUR.COMBAT.S:188`, `engine.py:676`)

#### Status effects / survival
- ✅ **Hunger / thirst** — `food` and `drink` deplete every 10 commands; "VERY HUNGRY/THIRSTY", "FAINT" warnings; starvation death when both reach 0; `eat` and `drink` commands restore them (`survival.py`, `commands/eat.py`, `commands/drink.py`, `SPUR.COMBAT.S:12–19`)
- ✅ **Poison** — tick damage (−2 HP); 30% chance per tick (`SPUR.COMBAT.S:15`, `survival.py:41`); STR reduction if ring worn is not yet implemented
- ✅ **Disease** — tick damage (−1 HP); 30% chance per tick (`SPUR.COMBAT.S:16`, `survival.py:50`)
- **Ring of power weakening** — wearing the ring has a 10% per-tick chance to reduce STR/WIS (`SPUR.COMBAT.S:14`)
- ✅ **Strength drain on hit** — taking damage reduces player Strength by `damage/2` (`ps=ps-(a/2)`); `ps` = Player Strength, not food (`SPUR.COMBAT.S:307`)
- ✅ **Too weak to wield** — if player Strength < 4, weapon is automatically unreadied (`SPUR.COMBAT.S:321`, `engine.py:290`)
- **Dusk warning** — message when session time < 120 ticks remain (`SPUR.COMBAT.S:11`)

---

## Flee

### Implemented
- Basic flee command exists (`commands/flee.py`)

### Not Implemented
- **Monster blocks path** — if player HP > 7 and room has `.` flag, monster may block flee (`SPUR.COMBAT.S:75`)
- ✅ **Energy cost** — fleeing costs 1 energy (`SPUR.COMBAT.S:76`, `engine.py` `flee()`)
- ✅ **Impassable rooms** — rooms flagged `@@` (water), `**` (snow), or `<<` (no_flee) cannot be fled from (`SPUR.COMBAT.S:74`, `resolution.py` `flee_attempt()`); flags parsed by `convert_from_gbbs_tool.py` and stored as `Room.flags`

---

## Weapons & Readying

### Implemented
- **Ready command** — choose weapon from inventory; display class/weapon stats (`commands/ready.py`)
- **Battle experience tiers** — GREEN / VETERAN / ELITE thresholds displayed on ready (`commands/ready.py`)
- **STORM — howls in rage** — refuses to be switched away from; zaps player; disintegrates (`commands/ready.py`)
- **STORM — jealous rage** — unreadied STORM in inventory howls when player readies something else (`commands/ready.py`)
- **STORM — servant** — accepts player with good class/race affinity; grants +2 skill/damage (`commands/ready.py`, `combat/engine.py`)
- **STORM — YOU ARE NOT MINE** — rejects player with no class/race affinity (`commands/ready.py`)
- **UNREADY command** — clears readied weapon (`SPUR.MAIN.S`)

### Not Implemented
- ✅ **Battle experience accumulation** — `vp`/`weapon_experience` incremented each time weapon is used in combat; VETERAN at 40, ELITE at 99 (`SPUR.WEAPON.S`, `player.py:573`, `engine.py:85`)
- ✅ **ELITE damage scaling** — ELITE tier grants +XP damage instead of flat +1 (`SPUR.WEAPON.S`, `resolution.py` `battle_exp_bonuses()`)
- **Dexterity requirement** — weapons have a minimum DEX to wield (`ws+4`); player refused if below threshold (`SPUR.WEAPON.S:46`)
- **STORM — duel behavior** — deferred until duels are implemented

---

## Item USE

### Implemented
- ✅ **USE command** — item list + numbered picker; delegates to type-specific handlers (`commands/use.py`)
- ✅ **Ammo loading** — `USE <ammo item>` loads rounds into readied weapon; checks `used_with`; sets `player.ammo_rounds`/`player.ammo_damage`; STORM refuses physical ammo (`SPUR.USE.S:147–162`)
- ✅ **Shield use** — `USE <shield item>` adds to shield rating; class/race caps (Wizard 25, Thief/Assassin/Pixie 35, Hobbit/Gnome 50, others 100); Battle/Lazer shield +20 to all caps (`SPUR.USE.S:34–43`)
- ✅ **Compass** — toggle `player.compass_active`; "USE again to return to pack" hint (`SPUR.USE.S:44–50`)

### Not Implemented
- ✅ **Ring of invisibility** — USE toggles `ring_worn`; worn: CON−2, "hard to see", evil senses warning; remove: "returned to pack"; penalty persists (`SPUR.USE.S use4`, `commands/use.py`)
- ✅ **Grenade** — hurl at room monster; damage = 1d10 + 5 + (xp_level × 2); no monster: "harmlessly"; kills monster if HP reaches 0; item consumed (`SPUR.USE.S:91`, `commands/use.py`)
- **Potion** — restore HP or stats (`SPUR.USE.S`)
- **Rocket** — single-use ranged explosive; several variants (TOW, LAW, Redeye, plasma, nuclear) (`SPUR.USE.S:97–130`)
- **Scrolls / spellcasting** (`SPUR.MISC3.S`)
- **Spacesuit assembly** — combine parts 134 + 135 with tool into item 122 (`SPUR.USE.S:58–72`)
- **Communicator repair** — USE tool on item 141 produces item 66 (`SPUR.USE.S:70`)
- **Slippers of Galad** — location-specific item effect (`SPUR.USE.S:25`)
- **Palintar** — links to misc6 (`SPUR.USE.S:20`)
- **Crystal vial** — location-specific effect (`SPUR.USE.S:23–24`)
- ✅ **Ammo consumption in combat** — projectile/energy weapons check `player.ammo_rounds` before swinging; "NO AMMO READY" blocks attack; `ammo_damage` added to hit damage; one round decremented per swing (`SPUR.COMBAT.S:44,84,99,144`)

---

## Items (Examine / Look)

### Implemented
- **look \<item\>** — searches inventory; STORM weapons show "There is much power in the {name}!"; potions, magic, cursed items have flavor text (`commands/look.py`, `SPUR.MISC3.S:316`)

### Not Implemented
- **Room item examination** — `look` at items on the floor / in the room, not just inventory
- **Magical/cursed detection** — currently uses `item.kind`; SPUR requires a skill roll first (60% failure) and tracks already-examined items in `xz$` (`SPUR.MISC3.S:295–307`)
- **Special item descriptions** — CRYSTAL PENDANT, ICE CRYSTAL, CROWN OF MIDAS, GOLD ROSE, PANDORAS BOX, TUT'S TREASURE, etc. (`SPUR.MISC3.S:310–323`)
- **LOOT command** — search dead monster for items (`SPUR.MISC3.S`)

---

## Flee / Travel

### Not Implemented
- **Stealth / sneak** — player class affects how likely monsters are to lose sight of them (classes 6/8 get `z=50` instead of class-based roll, `SPUR.COMBAT.S:24–28`)
- **Room travel** — N/S/E/W/U/D movement between rooms
- **Room flags** — monster blocking (`.`), no-flee (`@@`, `**`, `<<`), random encounter (`]`) — other flags (`+`, `#`, `-`, `*`, `@`, `&`, `E`/`G`, `;;`) belong to monsters, not rooms; see monster abilities in the Combat section above
- **Orator / Moderator player flag** — a player flag (name TBD — `Orator` or `Moderator`) that
  designates the speaker in an auditorium-type room.  While a flagged player is present, other
  players in the room cannot use `say`; instead they submit questions or comments via a `q` command
  which queues them for the Orator to address.  Good for town halls and structured announcements.
  Planned as one auditorium room per level for convenience; exact map placement TBD.

---

## Character Progression

### Implemented
- **Level-up** — XP threshold `999 + (xp_level × 100)` triggers level-up message (`SPUR.COMBAT.S:10`)
- **Stat rolling** — race/class bonuses applied at character creation (`characters.py`)
- ✅ **`xp_level` split from `map_level`** — these were conflated in one field (`player.map_level`), used correctly as the dungeon floor (SPUR's `cl`) by the elevator/shoppe but incorrectly reused as character level (SPUR's `xp`/`yn`) by combat level-up, the BHR stat formula, the XP-drain formula, Blue Djinn's hire pricing, and the bank transfer gate. `player.xp_level` is now the single source for character level; old saves migrate their `map_level` value into `xp_level` on load and reset `map_level` to 1 (`player.py`, `combat/engine.py`, `combat/resolution.py`, `commands/stats.py`, `bar/blue_djinn.py`, `shoppe/bank.py`)

### Not Implemented
- **Level-up stat grants** — what increases on level-up (HP, stats) (`SPUR.COMBAT.S lvl.msg`)
- **Time limit** — session clock `ev`; player is forced to quit when time expires (`SPUR.COMBAT.S tim.chk`)
- **Battle experience** — weapon-specific kill counter; VETERAN/ELITE tiers (`SPUR.WEAPON.S`)

---

## Duels (PvP)

### Not Implemented
- **Live duel** — both players online; weapon chosen from weapon roster interactively (`SPUR.DUEL.S`)
- **Autoduel** — offline defender; best weapon auto-selected by `zt+zs` score (`SPUR.DUEL2.S`)
- **Weapon roster** — separate from inventory; needed for both duel modes (see `combat/duel.py` for design notes)
- **No weapon penalty** — fighting without a readied weapon deducts 1 INT (`SPUR.DUEL.S:30–54`)

---

## Social / World

### Not Implemented
- **Guilds** — three guilds (Claw, Sword, Iron Fist); bank, food locker, item locker, weapon box, chalk board, log (`SPUR.GUILD.S`)
- **Bar** — ally hiring, drink/food purchase (`SPUR.BAR.S`, `SPUR.BAR2.S`, `SPUR.BAR3.S`) — see **Bar** section below
- **Ship / Space level** — space-themed level (likely level 7); room data in `SPUR-data/level-7/` (requires gbbs-io to decode); `SPUR.SHIP.S` handles its specific mechanics (`SPACE SUIT` replaces `BOAT` for water-room traversal at level 6+, per `SPUR.MAIN.S:158`)
- **Gates** — zone gate travel (`SPUR.GATES.S`)
- **Annex** — visitor area (`SPUR.ANNEX.S`) — see **Annex** section below
- **Shop** — buy/sell items, ammo, shields (`SPUR.SHOP.S`) — see **Merchant Shoppe** section below
- **Bulletin board / news log** (`SPUR.MISC2.S`) — see expanded design in **News & Mail** and **Threaded Message Boards** sections below
- **Pray / Rest** — recover HP or stats out of combat (`SPUR.MISC2.S`)
- **READ command** — read a book item from inventory; increases Wisdom on completion (`SPUR.MISC3.S`; tips.txt: "READ books to increase your wisdom!")
- **QUOTE command** — player sets a short quote displayed to others who encounter their parked character; referenced in `t_main.lbl` command list and tips.txt
- **LOOT command** — search an unconscious player's inventory; one item per session; Civilians barred from the Shoppe after looting (tips.txt); see also Items section above
- **The Dwarf** — permanent NPC on a fixed room on level 1; steals gold from all players until killed; killing him awards all accumulated stolen gold; room does not change between sessions (tips.txt)
- **Special room traversal requirements** — snow/mountain rooms (`**` flag) require a Great Coat (item #78) or player freezes; water rooms (`@@` flag) require a Boat (levels 1–5) or Space Suit (level 6+); checks in `SPUR.MAIN.S:313–319` and `t_main.lbl`
- ✅ **Wraith Master title** — players with `WRAITH_MASTER` flag get ", Wraith Master of Spur!" appended to their name at login (`commands/connect.py:251`)
- **WHO command** — lists currently online players; replaces the SPUR "last adventurer" login display (stubbed in `commands/connect.py:247`)
- **Guild follow** — player character automatically follows guild members to their location when logged off; toggle in settings (stubbed in `commands/connect.py:274`)
- **DIG command** — dig for buried items or gold (`SPUR.MAIN.S`)
- **WEAKEN command** — sysop-only stat reduction command (`SPUR.MAIN.S`)
- ✅ **GET command** — pick up items from the room; static room items and session-dropped items both handled (`commands/get.py`)
- ✅ **Fireball pickup burn** — non-Wizards picking up a fireball take 1–4 heat damage; gauntlets (item #68) absorb the hit with 10% chance of destruction (`SPUR.WEAPON.S:30`, `commands/get.py`)
- ✅ **Staff spellcasting hint** — Wizards picking up a staff see a reminder that it enhances spell casting (`SPUR.MISC3.S:47`, `commands/get.py`)
- ✅ **Monsters/players as GET targets** — live monster: "WON'T LET YOU!"; dead monster: hacked into `<name> MEAT` item placed in room; active player: "SKUTTLES OUT OF REACH!"; unconscious player: "WON'T FIT IN YOUR SACK.." (`SPUR.MISC.S get.b/get.plyr`, `commands/get.py`)
- ✅ **Monster meat** — eating `<name> MEAT` restores 2–6 food; monsters with `diseased_attack` flag have 30% chance to infect the eater (`SPUR.MISC3.S:369`, `commands/eat.py`)
- ✅ **Booby-trapped item pickup** — strange weapon (#70) / funny doll (#72): "BOOOMM!!" → INT−5, HP→5; Pandora's Box (#71): smoke → XP capped at 100, CON→5, INT−5, HP→5; Gold Rose (#41): DEX check, fail → −5 HP + poison; Fireplace (#81): "USE only" (can't be picked up); Obelisk (#139): too large (`SPUR.MISC.S get.itm`, `commands/get.py`)
- ✅ **Fireplace USE** — room 103 "East Hall"; `use` or `use fireplace` while in room: restores Strength to 20 and heals +4 HP if both were low; room message shown to bystanders (`SPUR.USE.S:187`, `commands/use.py`)
- ✅ **DROP command** — drop items into the room; water rooms (`@@` flag or keyword match on name/desc) show float/sink messages: metal weapons and heavy items sink and are lost, wooden weapons/food/books/darts/arrows float and remain retrievable; well rooms always lose the item; buoyancy inferred from category+name until a per-item flag exists (`SPUR.MISC.S`, `commands/drop.py`)
- ✅ **GIVE / TAKE** — `give <item> to <ally/player/monster>` transfers item to ally's carried list or co-located player's inventory; giving to a monster yields humorous responses (food eaten, gold kept by greedy types, etc.); `take [<item>] from <ally>` retrieves items ally is holding (`SPUR.MISC.S`, `commands/give.py`, `commands/take.py`)
- **Booby-trapped items** — items that trigger a trap effect when picked up (`SPUR.MISC.S`)
- **Pandora's Box** — special item with unique pickup/open effect (`SPUR.MISC.S`)
- **ORDER command** — rearrange the tactical order of allies in the party (point / flank / rear) (`SPUR.MISC2.S`)
- **Ally payment** — allies require weekly payment (gold) to remain loyal; non-payment triggers desertion (`SPUR.MISC2.S`)
- **Allies joining you** — conditions under which free allies in a room may voluntarily join the party (`SPUR.MISC2.S`)
- ✅ **Ally gold finding** — on each room move, any party ally has a 5% chance to find a gold sack (52–250 gp); fires at most once per day via `once_per_day` `'AYF'` tag; suppressed in water rooms (`SPUR.MISC6.S al.find`, `ally_events.py`, `simple_server._move()`)
- ✅ **Ally body building** — giving food/drink to an ally with strength < 11 raises their strength by 1; cursed rations poison the ally instead (strength −1, floor 1) (`SPUR.SUB.S hun.slv`, `commands/give.py _try_body_build()`)
- **Ally desertion / death** — allies may die or leave if unpaid, injured, or mistreated; status reverts to FREE (`SPUR.MISC6.S`)
- **Random events** — location-triggered events: little girl encounter, meteor strike, Enforcer arrival, Galadriel appearance (`SPUR.MISC6.S`)
- **Statue carving** — player action to carve a permanent statue in a room (`SPUR.MISC6.S`)
- **AMMO command** — view and manage ammunition counts (`SPUR.MISC5.S`)
- **STATS / STAT2** — two-level stat display; STAT2 shows extended information (`SPUR.MISC5.S`)
- **FOLLOW ME command** — causes nearby players or allies to follow the player (`SPUR.MISC5.S`)

### Future
- **Chat channels** — named, persistent channels players can join/leave (e.g. `#general`, `#claw`,
  `#trade`); guild channels auto-populated by membership; messages broadcast to all online
  subscribers; history stored server-side so joiners can see recent backlog.  Ties naturally into
  the prompt_toolkit split-pane client work: incoming channel messages scroll the output pane
  while the player types in the input area.

---

## Merchant Shoppe (`server/shoppe/main.py`)

### Implemented
- ✅ **General Store** — sells rations 1–10 (safe food/drink); duplicate check; silver deduction; pack-full guard
- ✅ **Elevator** — travel between levels 1–5 (`shoppe/elevator.py`)
- ✅ **Player List** — browse online/offline players by wildcard pattern

### Stubs (not yet implemented)
- **Armory** — buy and sell weapons; max 6 weapons per player (`SPUR.SHOP.S`)
- **Protection** — buy armor and shields; max 5 items per player (`SPUR.SHOP.S`)
- **Bank of SPUR** — deposit, withdraw, transfer gold; level 2+ required for transfers (`SPUR.SHIP.S bank`)
- **Wizard** — buy spells; Wizards pay half price, Druids two-thirds; max 10 spells (`SPUR.SHOP.S`)
- **Clan / Guild office** — change guild affiliation (Claw, Sword, Iron Fist, Civilian, Outlaw); costs gold and honor (`SPUR.SHOP.S`)
- **Pawn Shop** — sell (not buy) items to the merchant; all found items are sellable (tips.txt) (`SPUR.SHOP.S`)
- ✅ **Olly's Ammo** — buy ammo and ammo carriers; booby trap purchase; [H]elp explains ammo system and friendly fire (`shoppe/ollys.py`)

---

## Elevator Combination (Scrap of Paper)

✅ Implemented. Mechanic traced from `SPUR.MISC2.S:296-352` (`elev` subroutine, triggered
by `READ`ing item #69) and `SPUR.SHIP.S:375-388` (`elevator`/`elev.1`, the actual
coordinate check at the Shoppe elevator).

- **Item #69 "scrap of paper"** (type `book`) is placed in level 1, room 64
  ("Labyrinth"); no placement/randomization work was needed.
- **Intelligence gate**: SPUR.MISC2.S's `read` subroutine opens with `if pi<6 print
  "Not smart enough to read!":goto advent` -- Intelligence below 6 blocks `READ`
  entirely, before even listing books. Ported as-is.
- **`commands/read.py`** (new) implements `READ`: lists book-type inventory items, or
  reads one by name/number. Item #69 is special-cased: the first read asks the two SPUR
  flavor prompts ("Art thou true of heart?" Y/N, "Good or Evil?" G/E -- answering Evil
  costs 2 honor if honor > 2, no other branching), generates a random `CombinationTypes.
  ELEVATOR` entry, and prints it. Subsequent reads just re-print the same combination
  rather than rerolling.
- **Deviation from source, on purpose**: the scrap of paper is **not** consumed on read
  (SPUR's item disappears after the one-time reveal, making a forgotten combination an
  unrecoverable dead end even in the original). It stays in inventory as a re-readable
  reference.
- **Shape fixed**: `player.combinations` is now a `dict[CombinationTypes, Combination]`
  (was a list), matching `commands/editplayer.py`'s existing usage.
  `player.set_up_combinations()` seeds CASTLE and LOCKER at character creation but
  deliberately omits ELEVATOR -- that key only appears once the scrap has been read, so
  `shoppe/elevator.py`'s guard correctly refuses access to anyone who hasn't found it
  (the old code auto-generated a default combination for everyone, silently defeating the
  guard).
- **Persistence fixed**: `Player._load()` now restores `combinations` from the save file
  (previously not in the restorable-field whitelist, so every login silently regenerated
  a fresh random combination). Restoration accepts both the current dict shape and the
  older list-of-dicts shape already written to disk by existing player saves, so no
  migration script is needed.
- **Known pre-existing issue, not fixed here**: `Inventory.remove()` matches by
  `id_number`, but `item_system.Item` (used for `objects.json` entries, including books)
  never sets that attribute -- so `inv.remove(item)` silently no-ops for these items
  today. This doesn't block the scrap of paper (which is intentionally never removed),
  but it likely also affects `commands/use.py`'s shield/grenade/ring/saddle consumption
  paths. Worth its own followup.

- **Message boards (×3)** — three separate threaded boards (ties into Threaded Message Boards design)
- **Player rosters** — separate lists for Civilians, Mark of the Claw, Mark of the Sword, Iron Fist, and Outlaws
- **Locker** — personal item storage in the Annex; combination-locked (`SPUR.ANNEX.S`; also referenced in `SPUR.SHOP.S` and `SPUR.MISC2.S`)

---

## Bar (`server/bar/main.py`)

### Partially Implemented
- ✅ **Fat Olaf** — slave/servant trader; buy allies; sell servant stub present (`bar/fat_olaf.py`)
- ✅ **Food/drink menu** — `food_menu()` helper exists; rations list rendered

### Stubs (not yet implemented)
- **Vinny** — loan shark; apply for loans, pay back, store gold in bar; also arranges thugs (`SPUR.BAR.S`, `SPUR.BAR3.S`); stub present, full dialog not wired
- **Skip** — sells hash or coffee; simple food/drink vendor (`SPUR.BAR2.S`)
- **Bar None** — Guss the barkeep; coin flips, blackjack (`SPUR.BAR2.S`); our stub is `bar/bar_none.py`
- **Zelda** — reanimates monsters for players; studies and displays player stats (`SPUR.BAR.S`)
- **Blue Djinn** — hired hits; pay to have another player attacked (`SPUR.BAR.S`)
- **Bouncer** — enforces entry rules; role partially referenced
- **Bar brawl / PvP** — fighting other players in the bar; stub message "combat not yet available" (`bar/main.py:269`)

### Street NPCs (not part of `bar/main.py`'s room grid)

Unlike the NPCs above, these two are reached via a hardcoded level/room/direction
interception in `commands/movement.py` — mirroring how SPUR itself hooks them into
`SPUR.MAIN.S`'s dispatch (`if cl=<level> if cr=<room> if di=3 ...`) rather than as a
normal data-driven room exit. Both target rooms have no east exit in their room data
for exactly this reason.

- ✅ **Allies' Guild** (Bubba, level 4 / room 42 "A Maze Of Alleys" / east) — pay gold to
  train an owned ally: Armor (600g → `AllyFlags.ARMORED`), Discipline (1,000g →
  `AllyFlags.ELITE`), Body building (incremental, level 1–8, +3 STR per level, cost scales
  with level), Combat training (800g → `AllyFlags.COMBAT_TRAINED`), Tracking (750g →
  `AllyFlags.TRACKING`, refused for MOUNT allies) (`SPUR.MISC8.S` `s.guild`, skip branch,
  `street/allies_guild.py`)
- ✅ **Jake's Stable** (level 5 / room 157 "The Ocean" / east) — buy Oats/Sugar Cube
  (rations.json), Lasso/Saddle/Horse Armor (objects.json, ×100 gold); Train Horse
  (2,000 gold, requires a MOUNT ally that is already SADDLED + ARMORED, applies
  `AllyFlags.ELITE`); Tips (`SPUR.MISC8.S` `jakes`, skip branch, `street/jakes.py`)

---

## News & Mail

### News / Bulletin Board

#### Future
- **Startup display** — active news items are shown automatically when a player logs in, before the
  game loop starts.
- **`news` command** — lets players re-read current news at any time during a session.
- **Post editing** — sysops/admins create and edit posts via `text_editor.py` (the shared
  line-editor already used elsewhere in TADA).
- **Display lifetime** — each post carries one of three lifetime modes:
  - *One-time* — shown once per player, then silently suppressed on subsequent logins.
  - *Permanent* — always shown until manually deleted.
  - *Date range* — active only between a `start_date` and `end_date`; invisible outside that window.
- **Storage** — posts stored as JSON (e.g. `news.json`); each record: `id`, `body`, `lifetime`
  (`once` / `permanent` / `range`), optional `start_date` / `end_date`, and a `seen_by` list of
  player names (used for one-time suppression).

### Mail / Paging

#### Future
- **`page` command** — sends an instant message to an online player (appears in their session
  immediately).
- **Offline fallback** — if the target player is not online, prompt the sender to optionally
  deliver the message as mail instead.
- **Mail inbox** — unread mail is shown at login (similar to news display); a `mail` command lets
  players read, reply to, and delete messages mid-session.
- **Storage** — mailboxes stored per-player (e.g. `mail/<playername>.json`); each message: `from`,
  `timestamp`, `subject` (optional), `body`, `read` flag.

## Horses

Source references: `text-listings/t_mount.lbl`, `t_charge.lbl`, `t_main.lbl`, `t_stat.lbl`,
`t_startup.lbl`, `t_ma_blacksmith.lbl`.

### Overview
A horse occupies **ally slot 4** (`a$(4)`).  The string `"---"` in that slot means no horse.
At login, if the player has a horse, it is announced: *"Your faithful steed `<name>` is here."*
`[MOUNTED]` is shown in the player status line when the mounted bit is set.

### Implemented

These pieces come from a different source generation than the `t_mount.lbl`/`t_charge.lbl`
listings above — the skip branch's `SPUR.USE.S` (`lasso`/`eq.horse`) and `SPUR.MISC8.S`
(`jakes`), where a mount is a regular party-slot ally flagged `MOUNT` rather than a
dedicated "ally slot 4". `MOUNT`/`DISMOUNT` (Phase 1 below) follow this same
party-slot-ally model; `CHARGE` is still unimplemented either way.

#### Acquiring a horse
- ✅ **LASSO capture** — during combat against a horse-named monster (e.g. `WILD HORSE`,
  added to `monsters.json` as a TADA extension — no canonical stats existed in the
  SPUR-data dumps), `lasso` captures it as a new `MOUNT`-flagged ally; player names it
  (4–12 chars, SPUR's own forbidden-character list); blocked by a full party or an
  existing mount (`SPUR.USE.S` `lasso`, `commands/lasso.py`, `engine.py`
  `CombatSession.lasso()`)
- ✅ **Jake's Stable** — level 5, room 157 ("The Ocean"), reached by moving east (same
  hardcoded level/room/direction interception as the Allies' Guild — see the **Bar**
  section below); sells Oats/Sugar Cube/Lasso/Saddle/Horse Armor and offers Train Horse
  (`SPUR.MISC8.S` `jakes`, `street/jakes.py`)

#### MOUNT / DISMOUNT — Phase 1 of 3 ✅
Implemented against the block-diagram plan traced from the skip branch's `SPUR.USE.S`/
`SPUR.MISC8.S` party-slot-ally model, not the `t_mount.lbl` bit-flag design above.
- ✅ **State tracking**: `PlayerFlags.MOUNTED` (already existed in `flags.py`, already
  wired into `commands/editplayer.py` and generic save/load via
  `flags.serialize_flags_for_save()`) — no new `Player` field needed.
- ✅ **`MOUNT`** (`commands/mount.py`) — refuses without a MOUNT-flagged ally
  (`bar.allies.find_mount()`), refuses if already mounted, refuses in a water room
  (`SPUR.COMBAT.S:74` — water needs a Boat, not a horse). Sets the flag and prints
  "You climb onto `<name>`."
- ✅ **`DISMOUNT`** (`commands/dismount.py`) — unconditional while mounted; no-ops with a
  message otherwise.
- ✅ **Auto-dismount** (`commands/movement.py` `_auto_dismount_if_needed()`, called after
  every successful move) — clears the flag if the mount ally is gone from the party, or
  DEAD/UNCONSCIOUS but still in it (a combat loss leaves the corpse in `player.party` —
  see `combat/engine.py`), or if the destination room is flagged `water`/
  `water_with_rocks`.
- ⏸️ **Not implemented — half move-time while mounted**: the plan called for halving
  travel time on horseback, but this server has no move-time/tick system to halve
  (`player.moves_today` exists as a field but is never incremented anywhere; there's no
  session-elapsed-time tracking at all). Revisit if/when a real time budget exists;
  faking one just for this would be backwards.
- ⏸️ **Not implemented — mounting difficulty/saddle/strength checks**: the `t_mount.lbl`
  TODOs (character size, saddle requirement, strength vs. armor weight) weren't carried
  over; `MOUNT` only checks for a live MOUNT ally, water, and double-mounting.

#### CHARGE (`t_charge.lbl` design — NOT what was implemented; kept for reference)
- Requires horse in slot 4; fails with "You don't have a horse."
- Requires a live monster present; fails with a sarcastic message if nothing to charge toward.
- Water room: special joke message ("Clopping two coconut halves...").
- Horse strength gate: `peek(v1+119) < 5` → "Your horse is too weak to charge."
- Class attack bonuses: Fighter/Thief/Archer (cl 1/6/7): −25; Paladin (cl 3): +25; Assassin
  (cl 8): +35.
- Roll determines hit/miss; damage = `rnd(roll/4)`.
- TODOs in source: consider monster size (missing over its head); Knight lance bonus; player or
  horse taking return-attack damage; being unseated without a saddle on a heavy blow.

#### CHARGE — Phase 2 of 3 ✅
Implemented from the skip branch's `SPUR.COMBAT.S` (`m.attack`/`p.attack`), which has a
CHARGE mechanic entirely distinct from the `t_charge.lbl` design above (no water-room
joke, no horse-strength gate, no per-class attack bonus table) — the master branch's
`SPUR.COMBAT.S` has no CHARGE at all.
- ✅ **Eligibility roll** (`combat/engine.py` `_roll_charge_first_strike()`) — only checked
  on the first exchange (`monster_attack_count == 0`) while `PlayerFlags.MOUNTED`: d10
  roll, −4 for a projectile weapon or +4 otherwise, eligible if
  `roll + (monster_agility × 4) < player Dexterity`. Printed before the prompt each round
  ("MOUNTED- YOU MANAGE TO GET FIRST STRIKE! (CHARGE if you want)" / "...OOPS, DIDN'T GET
  FIRST STRIKE.."), and offered as `[C]harge` in the attack prompt when eligible.
  Independent of whether the player then picks CHARGE or a plain attack, achieving first
  strike skips the monster's retaliation this round (same effect as the existing
  missile/pole first-strike checks).
- ✅ **CHARGE bonus** (`combat/resolution.py` `player_attacks(is_charge=True)`) — +2 to the
  hit threshold and ×2 final damage (both the "ease of use" fast path and the normal hit
  roll), plus "YOU THUNDER DOWN UPON `<monster>`!" narration.
- ⏸️ **Known gap in `_WA` weapon-class lookup**: `combat/resolution.py`'s `_WA` dict keys
  (`'poke_jab'`, `'pole_range'`, `'hack_slash_bash'`) don't match the real
  `WeaponClass.value` strings (`'poke/jab'`, `'pole/range'`, `'bash/slash'` — punctuation
  differs), so `hit_threshold()` silently falls back to the hack/slash/bash formula for
  Poke/Jab and Pole/Range weapons instead of their own size-dependent formulas. Discovered
  while building CHARGE's projectile-vs-melee check (which is unaffected, since
  `'projectile'`/`'energy'`/`'proximity'` have no punctuation and match correctly) — a
  separate, pre-existing bug, not fixed here.

#### Mounted combat flavor & unseating — Phase 3 of 3 ✅
- ✅ **Miss over the top** (`combat/resolution.py` `player_attacks()`) — mounted with a
  melee weapon (hack/slash/bash, poke/jab, pole/range) can whiff clean over a small/agile
  monster: d10 roll vs. monster agility, independent of the normal hit roll. Doesn't apply
  to projectile/energy/proximity weapons or when not mounted.
- ✅ **Mount redirects a hit** (`combat/engine.py` `CombatSession._try_redirect_to_mount()`)
  — a monster's attack that would hit the player can instead strike the mount ally: d10
  roll vs. monster agility. **Narrative-only**: this port doesn't yet track meaningful
  mount HP (a freshly-lassoed mount's `hit_points` is seeded to 0 — see
  `CombatSession.lasso` — and Horse Constitution/HP display is still unported, see "Horse
  stats & equipment" below), so a successful redirect just means the player takes no
  damage from that hit rather than applying damage to the mount.
- ✅ **Unseat check** (`combat/engine.py` `CombatSession._charge_unseat_check()`) — risk of
  being thrown from the saddle after a CHARGE, win or lose (triggers whenever CHARGE was
  used this round, not on every hit). Formula: `d100 + HP + STR + CON + INT + EGY + DEX +
  (level × 3)`, +35 Knight / +25 Paladin / +25 Elf / −25 Ogre-Dwarf-Orc; score > 160 keeps
  the seat. Otherwise a Saddle gives one more (~40%) save roll; failing both throws the
  player, clears `PlayerFlags.MOUNTED`, and deals 2-11 fall damage (can kill).

#### Horse stats & equipment
- **Constitution & HP** — displayed on the stat screen alongside armor; "looks sick" / "looks
  weak" messages when low (same health-check loop as allies).
- **Armor** — horse has an armor rating; displayed in stat screen; no shield slot.
- **Race** — horse has a race (bits 6–0 of `v2+189`); cross-breeding possible by setting multiple
  bits (noted in source: "Thanks for the idea, DracoSilv").
- **Saddlebags** — bit 7 of `v2+189`; without saddlebags the horse carries no gold and no items;
  with saddlebags it can carry things (extra inventory).  Gold display routines explicitly check
  for this flag before showing horse gold.
- ✅ **Saddle / Horse Armor** — bought at Jake's Stable, then `USE`d on a mount ally to
  equip it (`AllyFlags.SADDLED` / `AllyFlags.ARMORED` — the latter shared with the
  Allies' Guild's Armor training, same "$" sigil in SPUR either way); refuses without a
  mount or on a duplicate (`SPUR.USE.S` `eq.horse`, `commands/use.py`)
- ✅ **Train Horse** — 2,000 gold at Jake's Stable; requires the mount already be
  `SADDLED` and `ARMORED`; applies `AllyFlags.ELITE` (`SPUR.MISC8.S` `train`,
  `street/jakes.py` `_train_horse()`)
- **Horseshoes** — listed as a TODO service at the Blacksmith (`t_ma_blacksmith.lbl:
  "todo: shoe horse"`); effect on speed or armor TBD.
- **Food** — horses presumably need feeding (appropriate food items TBD; ties into the
  food/ration system).

### Future
- Fix the `_WA` weapon-class string mismatch in `combat/resolution.py` (see CHARGE
  Phase 2 above) so Poke/Jab and Pole/Range weapons get their own hit-threshold formulas
  instead of silently falling back to hack/slash/bash's.
- Seed real mount Constitution/HP so "mount redirects a hit" can apply actual damage
  instead of being narrative-only.
- Wire saddlebags into inventory as an extra carry slot on the horse.
- Add horseshoe service to the Blacksmith shoppe section.

## Threaded Message Boards

### Skeleton — `server/threaded_messages.py`
A working prototype of a per-room threaded message system.  Current state:

- **Storage** — one JSON file per thread (`thread_<timestamp>.json`); each file holds `title`,
  `to`, `from`, `date`, `message`, and a `replies` array.  Currently written to a hardcoded
  scratch path; needs to be relocated to a proper data directory and scoped per room or board.
- **Operations** — create thread, reply to thread, list threads, view thread with N/P/R/Q
  in-message navigation.
- **Anonymous posting** — author prefixed with `?` to post anonymously; admins / Dungeon Masters
  see the real name behind the `?` (flag check stubbed with a TODO).
- **Input** — currently uses raw `input()` / `print()`; needs to be ported to `ctx.prompt` /
  `ctx.send` for the async game loop.

### Design Ideas (not yet decided)
- **`bulletin_board` room flag** — any room tagged `bulletin_board` would expose a board command
  (e.g. `board` or `bb`); the board's thread files would be stored under a key tied to that room.
- **Guild HQ boards** — each guild hall gets its own board; guild membership could gate who can
  post vs. who can only read.
- **Convergence with News & Mail** — the news system (see above) is single-author / broadcast;
  threaded boards are multi-author / conversational.  They share the JSON-per-post idea but serve
  different purposes and should stay separate.

### Future
- Relocate storage from the scratch path to `data/boards/<board_id>/`.
- Port all I/O to async `ctx` methods.
- Wire `bulletin_board` flag into the room system once room travel exists.
- Add `text_editor.py` for composing longer posts.

---

## Server Configuration

### In Progress — `setup/server_setup.py`
- **Invite toggle** — `config.require_invites` flag; toggled via the setup menu; controls whether
  new players need an invite code to register.
- **Invite management** — generate, list, and revoke invite codes (stubs in place).
- **Password encryption** — not yet wired up; plain-text passwords should be hashed before the
  server goes public.
- **Time zone** — server location / timezone configurable; feeds into the game clock (see Reactive
  Rooms below).
- **MOTD editor** — `edit_motd()` stub; edits `motd.txt` displayed at login (tie into
  `text_editor.py` when ready).
- **News editor** — `edit_news()` stub; separate from the in-game news system but could converge
  with `news.json` design in the **News & Mail** section above.

### Future
- Wire all stubs to `text_editor.py` and a proper `server_config.json` schema.
- Expose invite management as an in-game sysop command, not just a setup-time CLI option.

---

## Reactive Room Descriptions

### Prototype — `server/main.py` (Gemini AI, early 2025)
`main.py` contains a well-developed prototype worth preserving and eventually integrating into
`simple_server.py`:

- **`GameClock`** — singleton; wraps `astral` + `pytz`; can run on wall-clock time or advance a
  configurable number of minutes per player action.
- **`Season`** enum — `SPRING / SUMMER / AUTUMN / WINTER`; derived from current date.
- **`Terrain`** enum — `OUTDOORS / IN_BUILDING / INDOORS_CAVE / SNOWY / FOREST / WATER / DESERT`;
  rooms would carry a terrain tag.
- **Sun / moon position** — `astral` provides sunrise, sunset, moon phase for the configured
  server location; used to pick day/dusk/night/dawn description variants.
- **Reactive descriptions** — room descriptions vary by season, time of day, and terrain; e.g. a
  forest room reads differently at dawn in winter than at noon in summer.

### Future
- Move `GameClock`, `Season`, and `Terrain` out of `main.py` into a dedicated `game_clock.py`
  module so `simple_server.py` can import them cleanly.
- Attach terrain tag to room records; pipe current season + time-of-day into the room description
  renderer.
- Server timezone (from `server_setup.py`) should be the single source of truth passed to
  `GameClock` at startup.

---

## Administration

Admin access is controlled by `PlayerFlags.ADMIN`.  Set it on a player via
`editplayer → Flags → Administrator` or with `editplayer` in-game.  The flag is
checked at the start of every admin command; non-admins receive "You lack the
authority to do that."

### Implemented

#### Player management
- **`editplayer` (`ep`)** — full in-game player editor: alignment, attributes,
  character names, combinations, flags/counters, hit points, inventory, money
  (In Hand / In Bank / In Bar), statistics, weapons (`commands/editplayer.py`).
  Changes are written on save/quit.
- **`ban <user> [reason]`** — permanently suspend an account; player is rejected
  at login with a "permanently suspended" message (`commands/ban.py`,
  `commands/connect.py`).
- **`ban <user> until <date> [reason]`** — temporary ban expiring at the given
  date; player is told when they may log in again.
- **`ban <user> from <date> to <date> [reason]`** — ban active only within a
  date window; outside the window the account is not blocked.
- **`unban <user>`** — lifts any ban immediately.
- **`ban #view`** — lists all ban entries with issue date, period, issuing admin,
  and reason; expired / pending bans are marked `[EXPIRED]` / `[pending]`.
- Ban storage: `run/server/net/ban-list.json`.
  Date parsing uses `parse_date.py` (see **Date Parsing Utility** below).

#### Navigation
- **`teleport <room>` / `t <room>` / `#<room>`** — instant movement to any room
  by number or name fragment.  Name search lists matches; unique match teleports
  immediately.  Guild-aligned destination rooms launch the guild HQ session
  (same as walking in). Admin only (`commands/teleport.py`).

#### World editing
- **`editmonsters`** — in-game monster editor; admin only (`commands/editmonsters.py`).

#### Visibility
- **`whereat`** — shows location of every online player; available to admins and
  players with DEBUG flag (`commands/whereat.py`).
- **`who`** — lists online players; admins see the player's account ID in addition
  to character name (`commands/who.py`).

### Not Implemented / Future

- **`kick <user>`** — disconnect an online player immediately without banning;
  useful for stuck sessions or rule violations that don't warrant a ban.
- **`broadcast <message>`** — send a server-wide message to all online players
  (equivalent to a SPUR sysop page).
- **`mute <user> [duration]`** — prevent a player from using `say`/`shout`/`page`
  for a given period.
- **`freeze <user>`** — temporarily prevent all actions (movement, combat) without
  disconnecting; useful for in-game moderation.
- **Invite management** — generate, list, and revoke invite codes via an in-game
  command rather than the setup CLI (see **Server Configuration** above).
- **Log viewer** — in-game or web utility to search and filter the pipe-delimited
  server log by player, level, module, and date range; `parse_date.py` is ready
  to back the date-range picker.
- **MOTD editor** — edit the login message-of-the-day from in-game rather than
  via `setup/server_setup.py`.
- **Audit trail** — dedicated admin-action log (ban/unban/kick/editplayer) separate
  from the main server log so moderation history is easy to review.

---

## Date Parsing Utility

`server/parse_date.py` — backed by `python-dateutil`.

### API
- **`parse_date(text)`** → `date | None` — parse a single date string.
- **`parse_date_range(text)`** → `tuple[date, date] | None` — parse a range.
- **`DATE_HELP`** — ready-made help string listing all accepted formats; embed in
  any prompt that accepts a date.

### Supported formats
| Input | Parsed as |
|---|---|
| `7/1/26` | 2026-07-01 (M/D/YY) |
| `7/1/2026` | 2026-07-01 (M/D/YYYY) |
| `7/1` | 2026-07-01 (current year assumed) |
| `2026-07-01` | 2026-07-01 (ISO 8601) |
| `Jul 1` | 2026-07-01 |
| `July 1 2026` | 2026-07-01 |

Range separators accepted: `to`, ` - ` (spaced hyphen), `–` (en-dash), `—` (em-dash).
Leading `from` is stripped.  Example: `from Jul 1 to Dec 31`.

**Ambiguity note:** dash-separated numbers (`1-7-26`) are read M-D-YY, so
`1-7-26 = January 7`.  Use slashes or month names to be unambiguous.

---

## Economy / Currency

### Future / Research Needed
- **Multi-denomination currency** — replace the current flat silver system with a period-appropriate
  coin hierarchy (e.g. copper → silver → electrum → gold → platinum, or whatever breakdown best
  matches common Middle Ages monetary conventions).  Need to research the actual exchange rates and
  relative prevalence of each denomination before committing to a design.  The existing
  `PlayerMoneyTypes` enum and `player.silver` dict are the main touch-points; shop prices,
  bank transfers, and all display strings would also need updating.
